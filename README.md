## About Me

Hi I'm Andrew. A fun fact about myself is that I can speak Mandarin and Cantonese fluently. Growing up, I spoke Cantonese, but I learned and became a fluent Mandarin speaker due to the 5 years I spent in Beijing between 2013-2018.

### How I put this portfolio together

This portfolio was created mostly by Bootstrap, with a few exceptions that required some CSS and a media query due to the image not moving as expected.

Tools I used from Bootstrap include:
* Navbar
* HTML Templates
* Container, header, footer
* Responsive image
* Rows and columns (grid), heavy use on the Portfolio page
* Viewport link

Bootstrap is a fun tool that makes it a lot easier to build a website, but I still feel that I need a lot of practice with putting things in the right place, such as knowing whether things should be inside/outside a container, whether elements should be split into rows or rows/columns, and so on. The biggest challenge for this assignment was that we were suggested minimal use of media queries, which did cause some problems with the image and text in index.html, as it did not respond as expected.

### What I did not complete

Index Page 
* Navbar turns into a drop down instead of sitting under the logo when resized
* "About Me" did not get centered when sized-down

Portfolio Page
* The copyright on the footer not centered because when I tried text-align: center, it worked but it also altered other parts of my page and I couldn't figure that part out

Contact Page
* Couldn't get the navbar/logo to be responsive, and sit on top of each other as needed to be mobile-responsive

I tried playing around a bit with Bootstrap and the CSS but I couldn't figure out the above issues in time. Jimmy, Saleej, and Jacob were extremely helpful in helping me dig out of certain holes at different stages of this portfolio. I promise to commit more time to my homework in the future so that I will have sufficient time to tinker with and fix the small things that I was not able to solve in this assignment.
